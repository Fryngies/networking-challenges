This repository contains my attempt to implement TCP server on top of SOCKET_RAW socket in Rust (I know, it should've been Zig), main purpose if which is to solve [Protohackers](https://protohackers.com) challenges.

The implementation may not use any external dependencies (\*).

- \*allowed to use syscall bindings (may be extended as I struggle).
